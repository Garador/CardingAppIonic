  <h4>About Extreme Cards</h4>
  <p>Extreme Cards is an app created for the purpose of allowing users to share
  and receive contact cards given away by individuals whom you trust, with a simple
  method of adding (via ID), instead of writing lengthy and often time-consuming cards.</p>
  <p>These cards can be used to maintain your selected contacts updated with the newest information
  to be provided to them. Also, if you wish to stop someone from seeing the card, you can delete it.</p>
